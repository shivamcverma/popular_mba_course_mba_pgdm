            "While both the courses have the same outcome in terms of employment perspective, there are subtle differences such as recognition, fees, etc. Since MBA admission has started for 2026 batch, with CAT , XAT , SNAP exam and registration dates announcements, aspirants must know the difference between MBA and PGDM to make a better choice of course and colleges. Below, we have listed five differences between PGDM and MBA:",
            "At the end of a PGP or PGDM course , the candidate is offered a Diploma. At the end of an MBA programme , the candidate receives a Degree.",
            "Is PGDM same as MBA? Many think that Diploma course does not have the same value as a Degree course but that is not true. Many IIMs and other top B-Schools such as XLRI, Jamshedpur and SPJIMR, Mumbai offer PGP or PGDM courses. Most of these institutes are autonomous bodies (not affiliated to any University). Between a PGDM and an MBA, the difference is of nomenclature but not of professional value.",
            "Both MBA and PGDM are highly valued in the job market as they are same in terms of course accreditation, curriculum and pedagogy. Another key factor is the institute. For example, a PGDM course from XLRI Jamshedpur will have more professional value than a degree course from a state university.",

            "In most cases, the MBA course curriculum is designed by the university. The core MBA syllabus (and sometimes even elective subjects) will be pretty much the same in two MBA colleges under the same university. Even though the PGDM syllabus is no different from the MBA syllabus, since PGPM or PGDM courses are determined by the individual institute, it gives them certain flexibility to design the course curriculum. The MBA syllabus undergoes change according to industrial requirements periodically. Universities tend to lag behind in updating the course curriculum.",
            "Since PGP or PGDM courses are offered by autonomous bodies, students need to be careful while taking admission. Many smaller colleges and institutes make claims but do not have proper accreditation status. MBA degrees are conferred by varsities, and hence there’s a lower chance of fraudulent claims. Management aspirants should look for genuine accreditations. Apart from UGC recognition , management institutes are accredited by NAAC, AACSB, AMBA and Equis.",
            "Also Read: Understanding MBA Accreditation",
            "Both MBA and PGDM courses have common core subjects. However, some experts claim most MBA courses focus more on theoretical and technical aspects of management rather than adopting a practical approach. PGP or PGDM courses on the other hand, have an industrial orientation and focus on skills-based on market requirements.",
            "It has been observed that most MBA courses have lower tuition fees as compared to PGP or PGDM courses. This is so because MBA degree is offered mostly by government institutions. These universities receive financial aid and grants from the government, making the degree cheaper for the student. In case of a PGP or PGDM degree, students have to bear the cost of the entire programme as private universities that offer these degrees have no government backing. However, this is not an ironclad rule. There are institutes which charge high tuition fees like the IIMs. The IIMs have high MBA fees despite not-being a private institution. This is because, it is an autonomous institution not funded by the government. However, the MHRD has some role to play in running the IIMs."
